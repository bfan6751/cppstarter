# cppstarter
A simple script to start a C++ project with CMake, spdlog and GoogleTest!

Simply copy the script to your desired folder and run the script using `./cppstarter.py` or `python3 cppstarter.py` and follow on screen instructions!

If you run into permission errors using `./cppstarter.py`, give it a `chmod +x cppstarter.py` to give it executable permissions.
